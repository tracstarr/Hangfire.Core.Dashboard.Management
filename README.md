Hangfire.Core.Dashboard.Management provides a Management page in the default dashboard. It allows for manually creating jobs.

## Features

 - **Automatic page and menu generation**: Simple attributes on your job classes define management pages. 
 - **Automatic input generation**: Simple attributes on your properties allows for auto generation of input fields. (bool, int, text, DateTime)
 - **Support for IJobCancellationToken and PerformContext**: These job properties are automatically ignored and set null on job creation.
 - **Simple Fire-and-Forget**: Directly from your Management dashboard you can fire any Job.
 - **Set a Cron Job**: Define your cron and set it for any Job.
 - **Schedule a Job**: Schedule your job to run in the future. (Currently 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min intervals)
 - **Extensable**: Use the framework to add your own additional pages. (takes so digging to figure this out)

## Setup

```c#
GlobalConfiguration.Configuration
    .UseManagementPages(<assembly with IJob implementations>);    
```
## Defining Pages

Pages are defined and based on your Job classes. A Job class needs to implement IJob. The class should also have the attribute 
ManagementPage defined. Everything within this class will be on it's own page and have a navigation item in the side menu.

Each function within the class is defined as a specific job. The function should be decorated with DisplayName and Description. 
Displayname will be in the header of the panel and description is part of the panel body.

Each input property, other than IJobCancellationToken and PerformContext, should be decorated with the DisplayData attribute. This
defines the input label and placeholder text for better readability. 

```c#
[ManagementPage("Misc Jobs", "Miscellaneous", "misc")]
public class MiscJobs : IJob
{   
	[DisplayName("Test")]    
	[Description("Test that jobs are running with simple console output.")]
    [AutomaticRetry(Attempts = 0)]
    [DisableConcurrentExecution(90)]
    public void Test(PerformContext context, IJobCancellationToken token,
            [DisplayData("Output Text", "Enter text to output.")] string outputText,
            [DisplayData("Repeat When Completed", "Repeat")] bool repeat,
            [DisplayData("Test Date", "Enter date")] DateTime testDate) 
	
	{
		context.WriteLine(outputText);
		Thread.Sleep(15000);
				
		token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();

		if (repeat)
		{
			context.WriteLine("Enquing the job again from the job.");
			BackgroundJob.Enqueue<MiscJobs>(m => m.Test(context, token, outputText, repeat));
		}
	}
}
```

## Caution
Things might not work as expected and could just not work. There has only been manual testing so far. If attributes are missing I'm not
sure what will happen.
